# About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language.

You can take part [here](https://adventofcode.com/2023)

Each day is a two part challenge, with one set of testing data. I'll split each day up into it's own folder & each part into it's own file.

I've added the challenge prompt for each day to the readme of each day folder.

To run the code, open up the project in the command line, and run `bun part-1.js` or `bun part-2.js`.

This will run the code and spit out the answer.
